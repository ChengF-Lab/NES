paper "A network-based deep learning methodology for stratification of tumor mutations"

'dataset' directory
Contain the somatic mutation data and patient clinical data.

'struc2vec' directory
Contain the proteinâ€“protein interactome network embedding method. Each gene generates its 
own characteristics.

'patient_feature' directory
Contain the patient feature construction method.

Tutorial
1. To get gene specific expression learned by gene_specific.py.
2. Tumor classification across various cancer types learned by tumour_classification.py.
3. Tumor classification for the specific cancer type learned by specific_patient_classificationA.py.
4. Survival differences between patients learned by patient_cluster.py.

Requirements
This work is tested to work under Python 3.7
The required dependencies for deepDR are gensim, lifelines, pandas, numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn.
